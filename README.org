# Disclaimer

I'm being work on a neovim configuration, you can check here: https://github.com/otavioschwanck/mood-nvim

This neovim configuration is based on Doom Emacs On Rails.

If you still want to use this emacs configuration, feel free, it's working perfectly.

* This project goal

This project goal is bring emacs and its powerful features to people that don't want to lose time searching and configuring stuff.  The doom-emacs-on-rails config is ready to use and easy to customize.  The user can change the user-settings.el the way he wants, receiving a lot of tips.  Doom Emacs + this dotfiles is the fusion of power and simplicity.

To access your personal settings, just press SPC f m.

The user can print a manual accessing [[Emacs Handbook.pdf]], also has a video demonstration with some cool commands below.

* Breaking Changes (Only for who installed before may 29 - 2022)
Some refactoring was done and the user settings files has changed.  Please use migrate your config to =user-settings.el= to =user/config.el= .

The reason of this refact is to improve (a lot) the performance and stability.

* Features
+ Made for Ruby on rails
+ Works with rbenv or docker
+ Works with rspec or minitest
+ Javascript support out of box
+ Cool stuff for Ruby Refactoring
+ Advance autocomplete and snippets management
+ Code Diagnostics
+ Best git client integrated (Magit)
+ Vim Keybindings

* Prerequisites
 - Git 2.23+
 - Emacs 27 with GNUTLS support
 - ripgrep 11.0+ =(sudo apt install ripgrep)=
 - GNU find
 - OPTIONAL fd 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands) =(sudo apt install find-fd)= (good for large projects)
 - typescript-language-server
 - solargraph
 - rbenv

* Automatic Installation
We created a bash script to make your life easier and install Doom Emacs automatically.
Just run the below command in the terminal on either mac or linux, choose what you want to install and have fun!

#+begin_src sh
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otavioschwanck/doom-emacs-on-rails/master/auto-installer.sh)
#+end_src
```
* Manual Instalation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Install my config
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/0tt049/doom-emacs-on-rails ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install

# if you use Ubuntu
sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep libtool-bin cmake tidy

# If you use Mac
brew install fd ripgrep

# Install dependencies for LSP
npm install -g vscode-css-languageserver-bin vscode-html-languageserver-bin typescript-language-server @tailwindcss/language-server@0.0.4 stylelint js-beautify import-js

gem install solargraph
#+END_SRC

* After Install
Open your personal configuration with =SPC f m= and read the file.  I really recommend to read all comments on file, this file contains a lot of tips for improve your workflow.

* How to Use this config + Keybindings
I've write an emacs handbook to use this config.  You can access the text version using ~SPC f h~ inside emacs.

The text version is here: [[file:docs/handbook.org][emacs-handbook.org]]

* Customizing
~SPC f m~ - Your personal settings
~SPC f i~ - Where you can add your own modules
~SPC f I~ - Where you can add your own packages

See more on the handbook (~SPC f h~)

* Upgrading
To upgrade, just press M-x and search for =upgrade-doom-emacs-on-rails=

* Video Showcase + Guide
I made a video showcase with the principal commands (See description all the video highlights)

* Installing Emacs on Mac
Just install from https://emacsformacosx.com/

Tip:  To work, go to applications, right click and then, open.

* What i need to know to start using ?
I really recommend you to learn the basics of vim first, choose one:

+ [[https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/][Vim Udemy Course]] (non-free) (for vim) (3h course) (very good course, i did this) (Very Complete!)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER5JYFKkYDg][Vim Tutorial pt 1]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tExTz7GnpdQ][Vim Tutorial pt 2]] (free) (basic)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3o4l4GVLW0&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R][Vim Youtube Course - 6 Videos, ignore the 6]] (free) (basic-intermediary)

After that, you can see the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj][Doom Casts]] to learn the basics of doom emacs (optional)
Don't forget to see the =evil cheatsheet pt-BR.png= on the root of this repository!

Don'tt forget the [[https://discord.gg/qvGgnVx][Doom Emacs Discord Server]], is always full of people that always helps!
You can get help of any command on doom with SPC h p (function) of SPC h k + keybinding = (to see the options, etc.)
