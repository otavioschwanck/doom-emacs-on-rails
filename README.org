* This project goal

This project goal is bring emacs and its powerful features to people that don't want to lose time searching and configuring stuff.  The doom-emacs-on-rails config is ready to use and easy to customize.  The user can change the user.org the way he wants, receiving a lot of tips.  Doom Emacs + this dotfiles is the fusion of power and simplicity.

The user can print a manual accessing [[Emacs Handbook.pdf]], also has a video demonstration with some cool commands below.

* Features
+ Made for Ruby on rails
+ Javascript support
+ Cool stuff for Ruby Refactoring
+ Advance autocomplete and snippets management
+ Code Diagnostics
+ Best git client integrated (Magit)
+ Vim Keybindings

* Prerequisites
 - Git 2.23+
 - Emacs 27 with GNUTLS support
 - ripgrep 11.0+ =(sudo apt install ripgrep)=
 - GNU find
 - OPTIONAL fd 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands) =(sudo apt install find-fd)= (good for large projects)
 - typescript-language-server =(npm install -g typescript-language-server)=

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Install my config
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/otavioschwanck/doom_emacs_dotfiles.git ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install

# Some dependencies (ubuntu)
sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep libtool-bin cmake tidy

# If you use mac
brew install fd ripgrep

# Install dependencies for LSP
npm install -g vscode-css-languageserver-bin vscode-html-languageserver-bin typescript-language-server @tailwindcss/language-server@0.0.4 stylelint js-beautify
gem install solargraph
#+END_SRC

* After Install
Open your personal configuration with =SPC f P= user.org and read the file

* Keybindings

I've write an emacs handbook to use this config.  You can access using emacs with SPC f p, than searching for handbook.  (Require M-x pdf-tools-install).

The PDF is on this project root: [[Emacs Handbook.pdf]]

This PDF is perfect to be printed out or be used on second monitor.

* Video Showcase + Guide
I made a video showcase with the principal commands (See description all the video highlights)

#+caption: Method Creating at point
[[method at point.gif]]
Please ignore the wrong comment at line 8 =D.

#+caption: Snippets, snippets SNIPPETS!
[[snippets.gif]]
Obs about snippets:  You dont need to press Ctrl + space, just tab already completes!

* Tips
** Configuring Forge for Creating / Reviewing pull requests
*** For github
1 - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a personal token with =repo (all)=, =read:org= and =user=

2 - Don't forget to configure your user in github with git config --global github.user youruser

3 - Create a file called =~/.authinfo=

4 - add =machine api.github.com login youruser^forge password yourtokenhere= and =machine api.github.com login otavioschwanck^github-review password yourtokenhere= to this file

5 - M-x =epa-encrypt-file= and select =~/.authinfo= to encrypt with gpg.

6 - delete the =~/.authinfo=

*** For other git server
See: https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/source-control/forge-configuration.html and https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html
** Improve emacs speed (a lot)
Use Emacs Server: https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Emacs_server

Resume:  run =emacs --daemon= on system start.  To open an emacs window, use emacsclient -c instead emacs.

* Getting help
For getting help, access doom official github page: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs

* Want to learn how to use advanced commands from this config inside emacs?
Just follow this gif:  https://imgur.com/J3KzrPK

* Installing Emacs on Ubuntu
Just run `sudo snap install emacs --classic`

* Installing Emacs on Mac
Just install from https://emacsformacosx.com/

Tip:  To work, go to applications, right click and then, open.

* What i need to know to start using ?
I really recommend you to learn the basics of vim first, choose one:

+ [[https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/][Vim Udemy Course]] (non-free) (for vim) (3h course) (very good course, i did this) (Very Complete!)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER5JYFKkYDg][Vim Tutorial pt 1]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tExTz7GnpdQ][Vim Tutorial pt 2]] (free) (basic)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3o4l4GVLW0&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R][Vim Youtube Course - 6 Videos, ignore the 6]] (free) (basic-intermediary)

After that, you can see the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj][Doom Casts]] to learn the basics of doom emacs (optional)
Don't forget to see the =evil cheatsheet pt-BR.png= on the root of this repository!

Don'tt forget the [[https://discord.gg/qvGgnVx][Doom Emacs Discord Server]], is always full of people that always helps!
You can get help of any command on doom with SPC h p (function) of SPC h k + keybinding = (to see the options, etc.)
