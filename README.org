* Description
# Personal configuration for doom emacs

+ Working with JS
+ Full functional with Ruby on Rails
+ Some new functions added from vanilla doom emacs.
+ Solargraph for autocompletes (C-p and C-S-p to complete with buffers text)
+ Magit for awesome git usage and pull request creation / review.

* Prerequisites
 - Git 2.23+
 - Emacs 26.1+ (27 is recommended) with GNUTLS support
 - ripgrep 11.0+
 - GNU find
 - OPTIONAL fd 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands)
 - Solargraph

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/otavioschwanck/doom_emacs_dotfiles.git ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC

* Method Generator
I've developed a emacs function to generate methods in Ruby files.  To use, just press =C-M-enter=.
If the method name is init, it creates a initialize settings the args on instance variables.

Syntax: method_name@arg_1,arg_2,arg_n;method_two@arg_1,arg_2,arg_n

* Configuring Forge for Creating / Reviewing pull requests
** For github
1 - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a personal token with =repo (all)=, =read:org= and =user=
2 - Don't forget to configure your user in github with git config --global github.user youruser
3 - Create a file called =~/.authinfo=
4 - add =machine api.github.com login youruser^forge password yourtokenhere= to this file
5 - M-x =epa-encrypt-file= and select =~/authinfo= to encrypt with gpg.
6 - delete the =~/.authinfo=

** For other git server
See: https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/source-control/forge-configuration.html and https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html

* Tips
** Search and replace in whole project
*** Replacing a text
You can search and replace by pressing =SPC s p= to search in project, then, =C-c C-e= to open the search on a buffer.  To replace some word, just run =:%s/old_text/new_text/g=. You also can use the multiple cursors.

*** Renaming multiple files
If you want to also, rename multiple files in project, just run =M-x= =find-dired= and type -name "*your_class.*.extension". It will open a dired with all matches in the project.  Just press =C-e C-e= to toggle the edit mode and edit the filenames like a text file!
Press C-c C-c to confirm the edit or C-c C-k to cancel.

** Multiple-cursors
To use multiple-cursors, select the word, then, press =M-d= to go foward or =M-D= to go backwards.  Press =C= to edit all.
