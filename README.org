* Tips
** Configuring Forge for Creating / Reviewing pull requests
*** For github
1 - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a personal token with =repo (all)=, =read:org= and =user=

2 - Don't forget to configure your user in github with git config --global github.user youruser

3 - Create a file called =~/.authinfo=

4 - add =machine api.github.com login youruser^forge password yourtokenhere= and =machine api.github.com login otavioschwanck^github-review password yourtokenhere= to this file

5 - M-x =epa-encrypt-file= and select =~/.authinfo= to encrypt with gpg.

6 - delete the =~/.authinfo=

*** For other git server
See: https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/source-control/forge-configuration.html and https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html

* Keybindings

I've write an emacs handbook to use this config.  You can access using emacs with SPC f p, than searching for handbook.  (Require M-x pdf-tools-install).

The PDF is on this project root [[file:Emacs Handbook.pdf]].

This PDF is perfect to be printed out or be used on second monitor.

* Getting help
For getting help, access doom official github page: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs

* Installing Emacs on Ubuntu
Just run `sudo snap install emacs --classic`

* What i need to know to start using ?
I really recommend you to learn the basics of vim first, choose one:

+ [[https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/][Vim Udemy Course]] (non-free) (for vim) (3h course) (very good course, i did this) (Very Complete!)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER5JYFKkYDg][Vim Tutorial pt 1]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tExTz7GnpdQ][Vim Tutorial pt 2]] (free) (basic)
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3o4l4GVLW0&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R][Vim Youtube Course - 6 Videos, ignore the 6]] (free) (basic-intermediary)

After that, you can see the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj][Doom Casts]] to learn the basics of doom emacs (optional)
Don't forget to see the =evil cheatsheet pt-BR.png= on the root of this repository!

Don'tt forget the [[https://discord.gg/qvGgnVx][Doom Emacs Discord Server]], is always full of people that always helps!
You can get help of any command on doom with SPC h p (function) of SPC h k + keybinding = (to see the options, etc.)
