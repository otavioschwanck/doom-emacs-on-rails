;;; Commentary:

;; This is a package to help you find and insert rails routes into your code.
;; Instead of going to the terminal or loading the path in the browser, you just call 'rails-routes-insert',
;; It will fetch and save on cache all routes used by your application, so you have a reliable and easy way to search
;; and insert your routes.
;;
;; New on 0.3
;; - Remove projectile dependency
;; - Add command to insert routes ignoring cache
;; - Improve cache upgrade
;;
;; New on 0.2
;; Add rails-routes-jump to jump to the route controller.  Works with activeadmin.
